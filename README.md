# RUB-RL
This is the repo of the paper On Reducing Undesirable Behavior in Deep Reinforcement Learning Models

In the paper, there were 3 different case studies presented:
- Aurora (PCC-RL-master)
- TrafficControl
- Snake

The code with our additions for each one of the case studies, is in each of the corresponding folders.

For Aurora, a python3.7 environment is *required*.
For TrafficControl, we used a python3.7 but it is not required.
For Snake, a python3.9 environment is *required*.
